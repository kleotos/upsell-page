      <p>When I was diagnosed with type-2 diabetes, I felt my life was over.
      </p>
      <p>I couldn’t enjoy the sweet foods I loved. I couldn’t walk without sweating like a Christmas goat.</p>
      <p>My blood sugar level was as high as 9.7. It was that bad.</p>
    </div>
    <h1>It Was So Bad It Even Affected My Bedroom Performance...</h1>
    <img src="./asset/2.jpg" alt="">

    <p>Just 2 minutes and everything goes soft.</p>
    <p>This poor performance affected my marriage in ways I can't even explain.</p>
    <p>My wife was always nagging and angry.</p>
    <h1>My Home Felt Like Hell...</h1>
    
    <img src="./asset/3.jpg" alt="">
    <p>The high cost of insulin and hospital treatments for my diabetes made me so broke I couldn't fulfill my family responsibilities.</p>
    <p>I couldn’t pay my kids' school fees or enjoy basic things in life.</p>
    <p>It was depressing.</p>
    <p>I Was Like the Walking Dead...</p>
    <p>I felt like nothing in life was working.</p>
    <p>I spent at least 150k per month on managing my diabetes with drugs and medical check-ups.</p>
    <p>Then, one of my friends introduced me to an unregulated roadside herbal maker.</p>
    <h1>I Thought Regular Roadside  Herbs Would Cure My Diabetes...</h1>
    <p>I imagined myself drinking soft drinks and eating cakes within 3 weeks.</p>
    <p>But what happened next will shock you.
    </p>
    <p><i><b>Guess What?</b></i></p>
    <h1>The Herbal Concoctions Made Me Worse…</h1>
    <p>Whenever I drank the smelly concoction filled with maggots and slimy ingredients, I felt worse.</p>
    <p>The herbalist said it was just a side effect and I would get used to it.</p>
    <p>At first, I believed him.</p>
    <p>But then I noticed ants rushing to my urine.

    </p>
    <p>My performance in the bedroom got worse.

    </p>
    <h1>I Went from 2 Minutes Man to 2 Seconds Boy...

    </h1>
    <p>My wife, frustrated, started rubbing it in my face but I couldn’t blame her.</p>
    <p>The whole thing was frustrating.

    </p>
    <h1>I Felt Helpless...

    </h1>
    <p>I got seriously  thought it was a spiritual attack.

    </p>
    <p>I drank all sorts of things from special water to holy oil, and even more unprocessed herbal mixtures.

    </p>
    <h1>Then One Day I Had a Deep Rethink...

    </h1>
    <p>Could it be that these herbal mixtures were making my diabetes worse?
    </p>
    <p>I asked myself.
    </p>
    <p>So I started researching and saw articles confirming my suspicions.
    </p>
    <p><b><i>Like this….
